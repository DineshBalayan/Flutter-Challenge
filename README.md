# flutter-challenge

As a user, I'd like to be presented with a splash screen before going to the app.

Create a splash screen with text "Flutter Challenge" which shows for 2 seconds before going to main screen



As a user, I'd like to be able to select a weekday from a list and be taken to that days' page when selected

Change count screen to include a dropdown with list of weekdays. 
When weekday is selected, open new container listing the weekday selected
