### Story
As a manager, I'd like to have a table where I can edit user email and phone as well as deactivating users.


### criteria
Table shows users from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users with main fields (name, username, email, address/street, phone, website) as well as a Active field.

It should be possible to edit email, phone and Active.
